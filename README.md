## About This Repo

üöÜ We will be building a Express Books & Movies application with **JavaScript** for learning how Express server can handle [Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)!

[Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) allows you to break up your application route handling into modular and mountable route handlers. This keeps your route logic organized and helps avoid having a single huge file with all routes. Using routers lets you define groups of routes with their own middleware that can then be "plugged into" your main Express app as you see fit. This modular approach helps structure Express apps as they grow in size and complexity.

## Instructions

- [ ] **Start the Application**:

  - In the terminal, run the following to start the server:
  
    ```shell
    npm start
    ```

Open your preferred web browser and navigate to [localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) to see the UI for your application.

> **NOTE:** The key combination `ctrl-c` will stop your client from running. Whichever current Node.js process is running in that terminal will stop on macOS.

Follow along with your instructor to create a splendid Express Books & Movies application! Happy Priming!
